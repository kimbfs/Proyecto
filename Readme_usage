Based on "keras-YOLOv3-model-set" for object detection by david8862

This new version is able to detect both colors and objects with an audio output, intended to help visually impaired people.

Steps:

1. Install all requirement libraries from "requirements.txt" file
2. Once everything is installed you will need to conect a usb camera and call the python file "yolo.py"
3. Press "space bar" in your keyboard in order to capture an image
4. Wait until the program ends with the detection (you will hear the answer). When VLC program closes itself, you will be able to take another picture
